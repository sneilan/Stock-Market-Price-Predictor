# Stock Market Price Predictor

I noticed that when I naively try to analyze price movements using my own mind without any tools,
I tend to remember movements from a couple days ago and maybe if I'm lucky a specific pattern or two. I've ceased using this method as a way to
actually get interesting insights but realized that tensorflow.js LSTM models work exactly the way a naive retail trader (such as myself) thinks about the market.
