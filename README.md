# Stock Market Price Predictor

I noticed that when I naively try to analyze price movements using my own mind without any tools,
I tend to remember movements from a couple days ago and maybe if I'm lucky a specific pattern or two. I've ceased using this method as a way to
actually get interesting insights but realized that tensorflow.js LSTM models work exactly the way a naive retail trader (such as myself) thinks about the market.

## What is an LSTM model?

An LSTM model is like a smart helper that can remember things from a story. It helps a computer to understand and remember important parts of the story, even if the story is really long. This way, the computer can use what it remembers to make decisions or answer questions about the story.

To elaborate, imagine you have a toy robot that can listen to stories. When you tell your robot a story, it can remember the important parts like who the characters are, what they did, and where they went. The robot uses these memories to help it understand the story better and guess what might happen next. This robot is like an LSTM model. It's a special helper that can remember things for a while and use what it remembers to make smart choices in games, stories, or other fun activities.
