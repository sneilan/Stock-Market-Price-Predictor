# Stock Market Price Predictor

I love analyzing stock charts and learning patterns. Recently, I've realized that I tend to forget old price patterns over time as I learned new ones. This has spurred me to find new ways of studying the market to grow as a trader and software engineer.

I discovered a type of neural network that works the same was as my brain studying charts. It's called an [LSTM Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) which stands for Long Short-Term Memory. To understand an LSTM, imagine a toy robot that can remember things from a story and guess what might happen next. The robot works understand and remember important parts of the story, even if the story is really long. It looks for patterns in the story and does its best to guess what happens next.
